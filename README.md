### General
This is my submission for the Week 1 Assignment for the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development* course on Coursera. This course is the first course in the *Embedded Software Essentials Specialization* series.

### Contents
* `stats.c`: contains several functions to perform on an array (finding statistics, sorting, printing)
* `stats.h`: corresponding header file

### Compile
`gcc stats.c` or `mygcc stats.c`  

This produces an exectuable (`a.out`)

### Run
`./a.out`
